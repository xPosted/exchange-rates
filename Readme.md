Project are build using: 
   - Spring Boot framework
   - Spring Cloud Feign clients
   - Spring Data repositories    
   - Swagger documentation framework

Embedded MongoDb database is used as main storage, so project should run without any additional configuration.
Database files should be automatically dowloaded on first run. 
But offcourse you can use your own MongoDb instance aspecially if you want to use it in production.
